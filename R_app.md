## Machine Learning with Geographic Data

**Project description:** Geographic data is usually manipulated via GIS systems e.g. ArcGIS/QGIS. While these technologies provide a realtively user friendly GUI for visual manipulation of vectors, rasters, and images, analysis is limited to out of the box algorithms and methodologies. By moving GIS data into a pure programming environment we are able to use exponentially more investigatory tools including cutting edge machine learning techniques. Below is a brief overview of one of the studies I've conducted using ML for GIS applications. 
### Probablistic Archaeological Site Prediction

A Maximum Entropy derived occurance map for probable human habitation sites during the Bronze Age. This technique is the same as that used for presence only Species Dispersion Maps.

In order to produce the above map, various raster layers were processed both in and outside of QGIS. 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### Variable Analysis: PCA, ANOVA, Variable Importance.
```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques

### 4. Provide a basis for further data collection through surveys or experiments
